# Logseq MCP Tools

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@joelhooks/logseq-mcp-tools)](https://smithery.ai/server/@joelhooks/logseq-mcp-tools)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with structured access to your Logseq knowledge graph.

## Overview

This project creates an MCP server that allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with your Logseq knowledge base. It provides tools for:

- Retrieving a list of all pages
- Getting content from specific pages
- Generating journal summaries for flexible date ranges
- Extracting linked pages and exploring connections

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Logseq Tools for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@joelhooks/logseq-mcp-tools):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @joelhooks/logseq-mcp-tools --client claude
```

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

3. Copy the environment template and configure your Logseq token:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Logseq authentication token
```

## Configuration

This project includes a `.env.template` file that you can copy and rename to `.env`.

You can find your Logseq auth token by:

1. Opening Logseq
2. Enabling the HTTP API in Settings > Features > Enable HTTP API
3. Setting your authentication token in Settings > Features > HTTP API Authentication Token

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

The server can be started using:

```bash
# Using the npm script
npm start

# Or directly with tsx
npx tsx index.ts
```

### Connecting with Claude

#### Claude Desktop

Follow the [Claude MCP Quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user):

1. **Important**: Install Node.js globally via Homebrew (or whatever):

```bash
brew install node
```

2. Install the Claude desktop app
3. Open the Claude menu and select "Settings..."
4. Click on "Developer" in the left sidebar, then click "Edit Config"
5. This will open your `claude_desktop_config.json` file. Replace its contents with:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"logseq": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["tsx", "/path/to/your/index.ts"]
		}
	}
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace `/path/to/your/index.ts` with the **exact** absolute path to your index.ts file (e.g., `/Users/username/Code/logseq-mcp-tools/index.ts`)

6. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

Now you can chat with Claude and ask it to use your Logseq data:

- "Show me my recent journal entries"
- "Summarize my notes from last week"
- "Find all pages related to [topic]"

#### Claude in Cursor

Follow the [Cursor MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol):

1. Open Cursor
2. Add a new MCP service from settings
3. Enter the following command:

```
npx tsx "/path/to/index.ts"
```

4. Give your service a name like "Logseq Tools"

Now you can use Claude in Cursor with your Logseq data.

#### Claude in Anthropic API (generic)

When using the Claude API or CLI tools, you can add the MCP service with:

```
claude mcp add "logseq" npx tsx "/path/to/index.ts"
```

To extend with new tools, add additional `server.tool()` definitions in `index.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Node.js Version Managers (fnm, nvm, etc.)

If you're using a Node.js version manager like fnm or nvm, Claude Desktop won't be able to access the Node.js binaries properly, as it runs outside of your shell environment where the PATH is modified.

**Solution**: Install a system-wide Node.js with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

This ensures Node.js is available to all applications, including Claude Desktop.

#### Basic Troubleshooting Steps

- Ensure Logseq is running with the HTTP API enabled
- Verify your auth token in `.env` matches the one set in Logseq
- Check that the path to your index.ts file is correct in the Claude configuration
- Try running `npx tsx index.ts` directly in your terminal to verify it works

#### Viewing Logs in Claude Desktop

Monitor logs in real-time:

```bash
# macOS
tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```
